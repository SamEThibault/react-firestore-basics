# About:
Basic CRUD application using React, Bootstrap, and Firestore (DB backend switching to Spring Boot soon to de-clutter frontend). 
This project aims to help others get started with implementing this tech stack by providing well-documented code with basic functionalities covered.

# To Do:
- Modularize CSS for compatibility
- Add functionality: add document fields that can be updated, created, removed, retrieved
- Tweak nav bar to look better (maybe bootstrap option?)
- Build database viewer
- Transfer API functionality from frontend to Spring Boot API
- Deploy via gh pages when appropriate
